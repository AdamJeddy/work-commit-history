# Work Commit History Archive

## About This Repository ðŸš€ 
This repository doesn't contain any actual project codeâ€”think of it as a **commit time capsule**. It's here to track the commit history from my work account ([FG-Adam](https://github.com/FG-Adam)) and mirror my contributions on my personal GitHub. If you've ever wished your personal profile could reflect all those late-night debug sessions and breakthrough commits from your day jobâ€”this is my way of making that happen.

##  Why? ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
GitHubâ€™s contribution graph only reflects commits linked to a specific account, which means all my work under my companyâ€™s GitHub stays hidden on my personal profile. This repo exists to keep a record of my professional contributions while maintaining transparency about what it actually represents (spoiler: again, no actual work code here).

## What's Inside?
- **Commit metadata** â€“ timestamps, messages (sanitized if needed), and history.
- **No actual project files or sensitive information.**
- **Just a record of contributions**, not the content itself.

## The Goal
- âœ… Keep my personal GitHub activity graph reflective of my full work.
- âœ… Maintain a consolidated history of my professional contributions.
- âœ… Experiment with ways to bridge the gap between work and personal open-source presence.

## Questions?
If you're curious about the setup, feel free to reach out! Otherwise, this repo is mostly just a silent witness to my ongoing work in tech.
